package Third_Largest_Element;
/* 
    Given an array, arr of positive integers. Find the third largest element in it. 
    Return -1 if the third largest element is not found.

    Naive Approach (by sorting):
    The idea is to sort the array in Ascending order and return the third largest element 
    in the array which will be present at (n-3)â€™th index.
    (OR)
    Sort the array in Descending order and return the 2nd index element which will be the third largest element.

    Test Cases: 1110 / 1120 passed on GeekForGeeks

    Examples:
    Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The third largest element in the array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] is 3.

    Input: arr[] = [10, 2]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: There are less than three elements in the array, so the third largest element cannot be determined.
